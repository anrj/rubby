## ✅ What's Working Well

### Communication
-   Our in-person meetings are incredibly effective for making major decisions and ensuring everyone is aligned.
-   Discord is great for quick check-ins and sharing resources.
-   The "communicate blockers early" principle is being respected.

### Technical Collaboration
-   Nikoloz (Backend) and Davit (Visionary) are working closely to ensure the product vision is technically feasible.
-   The use of a `main` + feature branch strategy in GitHub is clear and working smoothly for initial project setup.

### Task Management
-   Using Notion/Obsidian for initial planning and documentation has helped organize our thoughts.
-   The decision-making process (Visionary for routine, unanimous for major) is clear and has prevented early disagreements.

## ⚠️ What Needs Improvement

### Challenge 1: Clarifying Undefined Roles

**Description:** The roles for Anri (AI Integration) and Giorgi (UI/UX Designer) are not yet fully defined in the team contract. This is causing some ambiguity in their day-to-day tasks and what they should be focusing on.

**Impact:** This could lead to a bottleneck in Weeks 5-6 when backend will need final UI designs and a clear AI implementation plan. Anri and Giorgi are currently underutilized.

**Proposed Solution:**
1.  Davit (Visionary) to create a prioritized MVP feature list.
2.  Giorgi to create wireframes for the top 3 features on that list.
3.  Anri to research and propose 2-3 specific AI/LLM integration strategies for the core Socratic dialogue feature.
4.  Update the team contract with their defined responsibilities by the end of Week 5.

**Owner:** Davit Kutateladze

**Target Date:** Week 5

---

### Challenge 2: Transitioning from Planning to Execution

**Description:** We have excellent documentation in Notion and Obsidian, but we're struggling to convert these plans into actionable, small-sized tickets or tasks for our development workflow.

**Impact:** There's a risk that we spend too much time in the planning phase and fall behind on the implementation timeline. It's difficult to track concrete progress.

**Proposed Solution:**
1.  Dedicate the first hour of our next in-person meeting to a "sprint planning" session.
2.  Break down the MVP features into small, specific tasks (e.g., "Create API endpoint for user login," "Design main chat bubble component").
3.  Assign the first set of tasks to team members for the next sprint (Weeks 5-6).

**Owner:** Nikoloz Tukhashvili

**Target Date:** Beginning of Week 5

## 🔄 Updated Team Contract (If Changes Needed)

No changes are needed for the team contract this week. We will revisit this in Week 5 after the roles for Anri and Giorgi have been formalized.

---

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Team-Level Risks

**Risk 1: Role Ambiguity Bottleneck**

**Description:** If the UI/UX and AI Integration roles are not clarified soon, the backend development will be blocked in Weeks 6-7, causing a major delay.

**Likelihood:** High

**Impact:** High

**Mitigation Plan:**
-   Implement the proposed solution from "Challenge 1" immediately.
-   Davit will provide a draft MVP list within 48 hours.
-   Hold a dedicated meeting to finalize roles and responsibilities.

**Early Warning Signs:**
-   Anri and Giorgi report having nothing to do in the next check-in.
-   Nikoloz reports being blocked on frontend requirements.

**Escalation Path:**
-   If roles are not defined by the end of Week 5, the entire team will hold an emergency meeting to resolve it.

---

**Risk 2: Scope Creep**

**Description:** The Visionary's role is to think big, but this could lead to adding too many features to the MVP, making it impossible to complete within the semester.

**Likelihood:** Medium

**Impact:** High

**Mitigation Plan:**
-   Strictly adhere to the "Major Decisions" process (unanimous agreement) for adding any new feature to the MVP.
-   Clearly label features as "MVP" vs. "Post-Semester" in the backlog.
-   Nikoloz (Backend Lead) is responsible for raising concerns about the technical effort required for new ideas.

**Early Warning Signs:**
-   The prioritized backlog for the MVP grows week after week.
-   Team members feel overwhelmed by the number of "P1" tasks.

**Escalation Path:**
-   If the team cannot agree on the scope, consult the team contract's conflict resolution steps.

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Velocity (Tasks Completed per Week)

| Week | Planned | Completed | % |
|------|---------|-----------|---|
| 3 | 4 | 4 | 100% |
| 4 | 5 | 3 | 60% |

**Trend:** ⬇️ Declining

**Insights:**
-   Our velocity has dipped this week because tasks are becoming less defined ("research" vs. "build X"). This highlights the need to break down our plans into smaller, concrete development tasks as outlined in "Challenge 2."

---

## 💪 Team Strengths

**Technical Skills:**
-   Strong backend architecture and development skills (Nikoloz).
-   Deep understanding of product vision and user needs (Davit).

**Collaboration:**
-   Highly effective and efficient in-person meetings.
-   Respectful and open communication culture.

**Problem-Solving:**
-   Clear processes for decision-making and conflict resolution.
-   Proactive in identifying potential risks before they become major issues.

## 🎯 Goals for Next 2 Weeks

### Team Goals
1.  Finalize and document the full scope for the MVP.
2.  Define and document the specific roles and responsibilities for Anri and Giorgi.
